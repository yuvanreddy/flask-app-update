- Expected completion: 15-20 minutes from start
- Resources being deleted:
  - VPC and networking components
  - NAT Gateways
  - Internet Gateway
  - Route Tables

## 🛠️ Issues Resolved

### **Issue 1: Helm Release State Conflict**
**Problem:** Terraform couldn't refresh Helm release state because cluster was already deleted

**Solution Applied:**
```powershell
terraform state rm helm_release.aws_load_balancer_controller
```

**Result:** ✅ Resolved - Terraform destroy now proceeding

---

```
✅ EKS Cluster: flask-eks (ResourceNotFoundException)
✅ Application Load Balancers: None found
✅ Kubernetes Deployments: All removed
✅ Kubernetes Services: All removed
✅ Kubernetes Ingress: All removed

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### **Check if cluster exists:**
```powershell
aws eks describe-cluster --name flask-eks --region us-east-1
# Result: ResourceNotFoundException ✅
```

### **Check Load Balancers:**
```powershell
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --region us-east-1 | Select-String flask
# Result: No matches ✅
```

### **Check Terraform state:**
```powershell
cd terraform-eks
terraform show
# Will show remaining resources being destroyed
```

### **Check VPC:**
```powershell
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-east-1 --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=flask-eks-vpc"
# Should return empty after Terraform completes
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Now):**
- ✅ Terraform destroy is running in background
- ⏱️ Wait 15-20 minutes for completion

### **After Terraform Completes:**
1. **Verify all resources deleted:**
   ```powershell
   # Check VPC
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-east-1 --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=flask-eks-vpc"
   
   # Check NAT Gateways
   aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --region us-east-1 --filter "Name=tag:Name,Values=*flask*"
   
   # Check EBS volumes
   aws ec2 describe-volumes --region us-east-1 --filters "Name=tag:kubernetes.io/cluster/flask-eks,Values=owned"
   ```

2. **Check AWS Cost Explorer:**
   - Wait 24 hours for costs to update
   - Verify charges have stopped

3. **Optional cleanup:**
   ```powershell
   # Delete CloudWatch log groups (if any)
   aws logs describe-log-groups --region us-east-1 | Select-String flask-eks
   
   # Delete S3 Terraform state (if no longer needed)
   # aws s3 rm s3://terraform-state-816069153839/eks/terraform.tfstate
   ```

## 🔄 To Recreate Infrastructure

If you want to recreate the infrastructure later:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform-eks

# 2. Apply Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

# 3. Update kubeconfig
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name flask-eks --region us-east-1

# 4. Deploy application
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# 5. Install monitoring
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack `
  -n monitoring --create-namespace `
  -f monitoring/prometheus-values.yaml
```
