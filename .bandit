# B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces - Required for Docker containers
# We bind to 0.0.0.0 because:
# 1. Running in Docker containers requires binding to all interfaces
# 2. Security is handled by:
#    - Docker network isolation
#    - Kubernetes network policies
#    - AWS Security Groups
#    - Load balancer configurations
# 3. This is standard practice for containerized applications
